This mod addresses the issue introduced in Minecraft 1.20.x and 1.21.x where the Netherite Upgrade Template was required to upgrade diamond armor and tools using the Smithing Table. By removing the need for the template, the mod restores the simpler upgrade mechanic from earlier versions of Minecraft, where players only needed Netherite ingots and diamond equipment to perform the upgrade. This mod is ideal for those who prefer a more streamlined progression without the additional step introduced in the newer updates.
